# ALANN-Detector


## required python packages

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib (optional: for debug and making images)



## installation

Run the test.py with python3 interpreter, in the same folder with detector.py.
Or... properly install it as a python package if you dare.

test.py shows how to use the detector code.

This is still an ongoing development.
